# AWS portfolio

The portfolio contains two separate approaches for creating an Apache web service by using IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) principles.

In project study one, the goal was to create a fully functional web service by using basic resources and services in AWS. 

In project study two, the goal was to improve the infrastructure code by reducing duplicate code and keeping the web service fully functional.
